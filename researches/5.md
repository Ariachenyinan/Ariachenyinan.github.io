##  Brief Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
In this research project, my main responsibility was conducting preliminary investigations. I utilized QGIS to conduct a classification survey and visualization (Figure 2.) of the surrounding public facilities along the inner side of the Second Ring Road (Figure 1.) in Nanjing.
Of particular note is the insufficient continuity of sidewalks (Figure 3.) along the inner side roads of the Second Ring Road. Additionally, there are occurrences of sidewalk illegal occupancy.
