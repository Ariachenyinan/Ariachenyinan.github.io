##  Brief Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
In the initial phase of urban design for the Xiaoqinhuai District, we conducted an extensive analysis of the existing businesses in the area and its surrounding regions. The objective was to accurately identify the future functions of the district and address the current deficiencies in functional allocation. By doing so, we aim to foster a synergistic development of the city, ensuring a harmonious integration of various economic activities and facilitating overall progress.
