  Our volunteer activities mainly involve collaborating with communities in Nanjing to provide architectural aesthetic education for teenagers.

  Inspired by Julia Child, I have gradually fallen in love with cooking. 
  Food is gentle like love and breeze and has the magic healing power,<br> 
  and it's never too late to pursue what you truly love.

  I bought my Canon with my first scholarship.<br>
  Whenever I have free time, I love taking it for a city walk. <br>
  The streets filled with vibrant city life and the beauty of flowers and trees always touch my heart.

  I have two little dogs, Meatball and Bony.
  Just like their names, one is a little bit chubby and the other is skinny, but they are both adorable.
